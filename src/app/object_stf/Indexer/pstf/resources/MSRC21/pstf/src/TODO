- store histogram in forest so we can pass it to a leafimage
- use a distimage class or named tuple?

- transform images when training/filling forest1
- optimize training
- void class in included in forest1 training weights, does this affect tree balance?
- should we normalize distimage0 before training forest1?
- check bounds on forest1 parameters
- use libbabl for colorspace conversions? (http://gegl.org/babl/)
- should we use cielab float instead of cielab u8?
- support H&E/arbitrary color deconvolution?
