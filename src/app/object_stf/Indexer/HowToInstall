Description: This is what I did to make STF run. It does not guarantee this would work elsewhere.

in setup.py
- enable libsvm # Doesn't work
- install libsvm
  1. From source code: https://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm 
  2. OR: sudo apt-get install libsvm-dev
         sudo apt-get install python-libsvm
- install opencv
  1. sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev
  2. sudo apt-get install python-opencv 

in "python setup.py install"
- sudo chown wenluh:users build/bdist.linux-x86_64/
- sudo chown wenluh:users dist -R
